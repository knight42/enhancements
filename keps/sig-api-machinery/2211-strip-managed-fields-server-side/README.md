**Note:** When your KEP is complete, all of these comment blocks should be removed.

To get started with this template:

- [x] **Pick a hosting SIG.**
  Make sure that the problem space is something the SIG is interested in taking
  up. KEPs should not be checked in without a sponsoring SIG.
- [ ] **Create an issue in kubernetes/enhancements**
  When filing an enhancement tracking issue, please make sure to complete all
  fields in that template. One of the fields asks for a link to the KEP. You
  can leave that blank until this KEP is filed, and then go back to the
  enhancement and add the link.
- [ ] **Make a copy of this template directory.**
  Copy this template into the owning SIG's directory and name it
  `NNNN-short-descriptive-title`, where `NNNN` is the issue number (with no
  leading-zero padding) assigned to your enhancement above.
- [ ] **Fill out as much of the kep.yaml file as you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Title", "Authors", "Owning-sig",
  "Status", and date-related fields.
- [ ] **Fill out this file as best you can.**
  At minimum, you should fill in the "Summary" and "Motivation" sections.
  These should be easy if you've preflighted the idea of the KEP with the
  appropriate SIG(s).
- [ ] **Create a PR for this KEP.**
  Assign it to people in the SIG who are sponsoring this process.
- [ ] **Merge early and iterate.**
  Avoid getting hung up on specific details and instead aim to get the goals of
  the KEP clarified and merged quickly. The best way to do this is to just
  start with the high-level sections and fill out details incrementally in
  subsequent PRs.

Just because a KEP is merged does not mean it is complete or approved. Any KEP
marked as `provisional` is a working document and subject to change. You can
denote sections that are under active debate as follows:

```
<<[UNRESOLVED optional short context or usernames ]>>
Stuff that is being argued.
<<[/UNRESOLVED]>>
```

When editing KEPS, aim for tightly-scoped, single-topic PRs to keep discussions
focused. If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR
with suggested changes.

One KEP corresponds to one "feature" or "enhancement" for its whole lifecycle.
You do not need a new KEP to move from beta to GA, for example. If
new details emerge that belong in the KEP, edit the KEP. Once a feature has become
"implemented", major changes should get new KEPs.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source
of this file) is [here](/keps/NNNN-kep-template/README.md).

**Note:** Any PRs to move a KEP to `implementable`, or significant changes once
it is marked `implementable`, must be approved by each of the KEP approvers.
If none of those approvers are still appropriate, then changes to that list
should be approved by the remaining approvers and/or the owning SIG (or
SIG Architecture for cross-cutting KEPs).

## Summary

ManagedFields is used to keep track of who has changed a field of an object, and Server-side Apply relies on such information.
While the managedFields is beneficial to resolving conflicts on updates, it is a bit verbose to many users because this field
could be quite large and generally users are not interested in this information.

This KEP is proposing stripping the managedFields on the server-side when users request objects to make the response less verbose.

## Motivation

Many users have complained in [kubernetes#90066][90066] that they got impacted by the addition of managedFields
(and the issue itself has received more than 100 thumb-up reactions), and we want to improve the user experience.

[90066]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/90066

At the same time, it is not ideal to only drop the managedFields on the client-side, because that would require every client
(such as kubectl or CLI tools written by users using client-go) to do the same thing.

With this KEP, the API server could return objects without managedFields on demand, so that least client-side changes is needed
to make the response less verbose. 

### Goals

* Strip managedFields on the server-side.

### Non-Goals

* Turn off managedFields. Server-side Apply relies on managedFields, we could not simply disable it.
* Clear manageFields only on the client-side.

## Proposal

<!--
This is where we get down to the specifics of what the proposal actually is.
This should have enough detail that reviewers can understand exactly what
you're proposing, but should not include things like API designs or
implementation. What is the desired outcome and how do we measure success?.
The "Design Details" section below is for the real
nitty-gritty.
-->

### Server-side changes

* Add three content types to denote the client expects the API server to strip the managedFields.
  * `application/json+unmanaged`
  * `application/yaml+unmanaged`
  * `application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf+unmanaged`
* Add a new serializer, say `UnmanagedSerializer`, which is able to strip the managedFields when encoding objects.
* Make the API server to use `UnmanagedSerializer` when encounters the above three content type.

### Client-side changes

FIXME: we need to set the `Accept` header on the client-side and perform client-side stripping if the API server still
returns objects with managedFields. I am not sure we should do this in `client-go` and `cli-runtime` or only in `kubectl get`.

### Risks and Mitigations

<!--
What are the risks of this proposal, and how do we mitigate? Think broadly.
For example, consider both security and how this will impact the larger
Kubernetes ecosystem.

How will security be reviewed, and by whom?

How will UX be reviewed, and by whom?

Consider including folks who also work outside the SIG or subproject.
-->

TBD

## Design Details

<!--
This section should contain enough information that the specifics of your
change are understandable. This may include API specs (though not always
required) or even code snippets. If there's any ambiguity about HOW your
proposal will be implemented, this is the place to discuss them.
-->

### Server-side

1. Add the three content types which represents the "unmanaged" format of objects to `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/types.go`:
```go
const (
	ContentTypeJSON     string = "application/json"
	ContentTypeYAML     string = "application/yaml"
	ContentTypeProtobuf string = "application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf"

	ContentTypeUnmanagedJSON     string = "application/json+unmanaged"
	ContentTypeUnmanagedYAML     string = "application/yaml+unmanaged"
	ContentTypeUnmanagedProtobuf string = "application/vnd.kubernetes.protobuf+unmanaged"
)
```

2. Add a new serializer to `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/` which wraps the existing serializers and
strip the managedFields before encoding:
```go
type serializer struct {
	inner      runtime.Serializer
}

func NewSerializer(s runtime.Serializer) runtime.Serializer {
	if s == nil {
		return nil
	}
	return &serializer{inner: s}
}

func (s *serializer) Encode(obj runtime.Object, w io.Writer) error {
	if _, err := meta.Accessor(obj); err == nil {
		obj = obj.DeepCopyObject()
		a, _ := meta.Accessor(obj)
		a.SetManagedFields(nil)
	} else if meta.IsListType(obj) {
		obj = obj.DeepCopyObject()
		_ = meta.EachListItem(obj, func(item runtime.Object) error {
			a, err := meta.Accessor(item)
			if err != nil {
				// ignore
				return nil
			}
			a.SetManagedFields(nil)
			return nil
		})
	}
	return s.inner.Encode(obj, w)
}

func (s *serializer) Decode(data []byte, defaults *schema.GroupVersionKind, into runtime.Object) (runtime.Object, *schema.GroupVersionKind, error) {
	return s.inner.Decode(data, defaults, into)
}
```

3. Make `k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer.newSerializersForScheme` returns serializers for the new "unmanaged" content types.
For instance:
```go
import (
	...
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/runtime/serializer/unmanaged"
)

func newSerializersForScheme(scheme *runtime.Scheme, mf json.MetaFactory, options CodecFactoryOptions) []serializerType {
	...

	yamlSerializer := json.NewSerializerWithOptions(
		mf, scheme, scheme,
		json.SerializerOptions{Yaml: true, Pretty: false, Strict: options.Strict},
	)
	yamlUnmanagedSerializer := unmanaged.NewSerializer(yamlSerializer)

	serializers := []serializerType{
		...
		{
			AcceptContentTypes: []string{runtime.ContentTypeYAML},
			ContentType:        runtime.ContentTypeYAML,
			FileExtensions:     []string{"yaml"},
			EncodesAsText:      true,
			Serializer:         yamlSerializer,
		},
		{
			AcceptContentTypes: []string{runtime.ContentTypeUnmanagedYAML},
			ContentType:        runtime.ContentTypeUnmanagedYAML,
			FileExtensions:     []string{"yaml"},
			EncodesAsText:      true,
			Serializer:         yamlUnmanagedSerializer,
		},
	}
}
```

### Client-side

TBD

### Test Plan

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Consider the following in developing a test plan for this enhancement:
- Will there be e2e and integration tests, in addition to unit tests?
- How will it be tested in isolation vs with other components?

No need to outline all of the test cases, just the general strategy. Anything
that would count as tricky in the implementation, and anything particularly
challenging to test, should be called out.

All code is expected to have adequate tests (eventually with coverage
expectations). Please adhere to the [Kubernetes testing guidelines][testing-guidelines]
when drafting this test plan.

[testing-guidelines]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-testing/testing.md
-->

TBD

### Graduation Criteria

<!--
**Note:** *Not required until targeted at a release.*

Define graduation milestones.

These may be defined in terms of API maturity, or as something else. The KEP
should keep this high-level with a focus on what signals will be looked at to
determine graduation.

Consider the following in developing the graduation criteria for this enhancement:
- [Maturity levels (`alpha`, `beta`, `stable`)][maturity-levels]
- [Deprecation policy][deprecation-policy]

Clearly define what graduation means by either linking to the [API doc
definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning)
or by redefining what graduation means.

In general we try to use the same stages (alpha, beta, GA), regardless of how the
functionality is accessed.

[maturity-levels]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md#alpha-beta-and-stable-versions
[deprecation-policy]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/deprecation-policy/

Below are some examples to consider, in addition to the aforementioned [maturity levels][maturity-levels].

#### Alpha -> Beta Graduation

- Gather feedback from developers and surveys
- Complete features A, B, C
- Tests are in Testgrid and linked in KEP

#### Beta -> GA Graduation

- N examples of real-world usage
- N installs
- More rigorous forms of testingâ€”e.g., downgrade tests and scalability tests
- Allowing time for feedback

**Note:** Generally we also wait at least two releases between beta and
GA/stable, because there's no opportunity for user feedback, or even bug reports,
in back-to-back releases.

#### Removing a Deprecated Flag

- Announce deprecation and support policy of the existing flag
- Two versions passed since introducing the functionality that deprecates the flag (to address version skew)
- Address feedback on usage/changed behavior, provided on GitHub issues
- Deprecate the flag

**For non-optional features moving to GA, the graduation criteria must include 
[conformance tests].**

[conformance tests]: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/conformance-tests.md
-->

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component be upgraded and downgraded? Make sure
this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing an upgrade/downgrade strategy for this
enhancement:
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to maintain previous behavior?
- What changes (in invocations, configurations, API use, etc.) is an existing
  cluster required to make on upgrade, in order to make use of the enhancement?
-->

TBD

### Version Skew Strategy

<!--
If applicable, how will the component handle version skew with other
components? What are the guarantees? Make sure this is in the test plan.

Consider the following in developing a version skew strategy for this
enhancement:
- Does this enhancement involve coordinating behavior in the control plane and
  in the kubelet? How does an n-2 kubelet without this feature available behave
  when this feature is used?
- Will any other components on the node change? For example, changes to CSI,
  CRI or CNI may require updating that component before the kubelet.
-->

TBD

## Implementation History

<!--
Major milestones in the lifecycle of a KEP should be tracked in this section.
Major milestones might include:
- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged, signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Proposal` section being merged, signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded
-->

TBD

## Drawbacks

<!--
Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented?
-->

TBD

## Alternatives

<!--
What other approaches did you consider, and why did you rule them out? These do
not need to be as detailed as the proposal, but should include enough
information to express the idea and why it was not acceptable.
-->

TBD
